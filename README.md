# Discord Emote dumper.

# Information.
I made this in 2019 whilst I was first learning NodeJS and had it stolen from me when someone asked for the projects code so they could use it for their own use. I never realized I had this until a few minutes before making this repo.

## Requirements & Dependancies.
Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to use this project
```bash
npm install discord.js-selfbot-v11
npm install request
npm install readline-sync
```

## Disclaimer.
I'm not going to provide instructions to obtain your discord token but google is your best friend. I'm also not responsible for any account closures or bans that may incur upon use. I've used this for the last 4-5 years I've had it sitting on my disk and haven't had any issues.

## Usage.
```bash
node main.js
Input your Discord token upon being asked and it will save to settings.json.
Right click and "Copy ID" on any server icon you want to dump emotes from.
Find the "dumps" folder within the directory you placed main.js
```
